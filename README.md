# Facial_Expression_Recognition
this code will help you build a system to recognize the facial expression. Which can be of great use to identify the customer satisfaction  in the field of customer support.

the use of the Open-cv, media pipe, python, pandas and scikit learn libraries 


DATASET:- 
a dataset is custom made in this system with the help of open cv.
exctracting the facial coordinate of the subject and storing them class wise in an excel file which is then converted to the csv file to work with the machine learning algorithim

'cap' variable is used to store the captured media file from teh source.

if cv2.waitKey(10) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
            
this line of code helps us to break the while loop by oressing the 'q' key on the keyboard 
            the use of a logic gaet is done in theis code (0&FF == ord('q')


expression_recognition_app.ipynb is an attempt to put the expression recognition system in the form of an app in the pc
